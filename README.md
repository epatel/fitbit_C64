Retro clock face for Fitbit watch OS

This is a quick little project I made to learn the steps to make a Fitbit clockface. I am long time Pebble user and 
I made a number of apps and clockfaces for it, and now I am starting to use the Fitbit. I see many similarities with Pabble,
which I like :)

There are some suggested improvements by [micheldebree](https://github.com/micheldebree) which are available in the `suggested_improvements` branch.

Have fun!<br/>
